A user should be able to follow a subscription.

this should be accomplished through the has many through relationship

read the tutorial again and figure out how it was accomplished.

pretty sure the db is correct, just need to implement the controls for it.

User is follower, subscription is follwoed
subscription.followers is an array of users who follow it

user.following array of all subscriptions followed by a user

follower_id = user_id
followed_id = subscription_id

user_sub.user should return the follower
user_sub.subcription should return the subscription
user.user_sub.create should create a relationship associated with a user

a user has many subscriptions through user_sub
user.subscriptions.include?(example_subscription)
user.subscription.find(example_subscription)

to manipulate the relationship, need subscribe and unsubscribe utility methods for user.subscribe(example_subscription)

need a user page to display their subscriptions (also can link to the account page)

add a button to follow and unfollow a subscription, add to subscriptions show page

redirect to subscriptions after unsubscribe
redirect to current subscription after subscribe

create a user page to display subscriptions, allow for removal from that page? (how did the hartl tut do this)

Create routes for user show page
create view for users
populate subscriptions and a unsub button.
only visible if logged in

get the ids of the shows a user is subscribed to, then run those ids against the subscriptions database and output the names as a list

Add links to the subscriptions within someone's profile page
